	    <h2>Three things from the reading material</h2>
	      <ol>
			<li>Browser support is necessary for different features to be able to be used in various browsers. I don't know much about computer things at all really so this helped me finally better understand why adobe flash can't just work like it used to anymore.</li>
			<li>I'd never heard of the web being categorized into the eras of web 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. I learned about the differences between them in the reading and it's interesting realizing just how recently social media came about because by the time I had a phone it was already such a common and normal thing, and it's crazy how far we've gone in web 3.0 already with generative AI and all.</li>
			<li>I hadn't thought about web design as internet art before and didn't realize how many such things there are that can be classified as internet art and will be discussed in the textbook. I had primarily just thought of it all as coding before and more "computer stuff" than art, but as I begin to use html especially I can see how much thought must go into web design when it's done for bigger sites especially, and I see there's a lot to learn here for me. Also funnily enough, I didn't know www stood for world wibe web until reading this introduction.</li>
		  </ol>
	    <h2>Semester project paragraph</h2>
	      <p>For my semester project, I'm not sure what exactly I'd prefer to do but it'll definitely be tea related. I'm the president of UTD's tea and coffee club and love tea a lot, so I'm thinking about ideas relating to tea for the website I'll be making. I may create a site for logging what teas I drink and when, and have categories for those to order them by type or by caffeine content or flavor or something like that. I may also consider making a website for my club instead and use that to list rules for the club and meeting dates and what tea and coffee we have at meetings. I'll have to decide for certain later after thinking some more, but I really want to do something tea related like this.</p>
