<h1>Favorite Movies Gallery</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
	  <p>These are my favorite movies because they all have certain aspects that I appreciate and enjoy a lot in movies. My top favorites among these either have amazing 
	  worldbuilding, plot, characters, music, animation, cinematography, or some combination of those things. The only one that barely has any of these is Twilight and that's 
	  just on here because of how humorous it is.</p>

		<h3>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
		<img src="images/atsv.jpg" width: 200px height: auto alt="atsv movie poster">
		<p>This is my all time favorite movie. I went to see it 21 times in theaters, over the span of 17 months, anytime I found an opportunity to when theaters would 
			show it again every so often. The animation in this movie is absolutely phenomenal, the music is so incredible, the characters are all great, every bit of design 
			in this movie is just top tier in my opinion. I also have a slight (okay maybe not so slight) obsession with Miguel O'Hara, the movie antagonist.</p>

		<h3>Twilight</h3>

		<p>Twilight is an absolute mess, it has a god awful plot and horrible characters that are just unbelievably dumb and weird, but it is one of the most amazing 
		movies to watch alongside other people because it is just so cringe it ends up being super funny unintentionally. This movie has so many problems but it truly 
		is such a joy to make fun of it with every watch. And it has some good music, I'll give it that.</p>
