	  <h1>My Dream Jobs</h1>
	  
	  <h2>Ideal Type of Job for Me</h2>
	  <p>I think an ideal sort of job for someone like me would be teaching in some way. I have leadership experience from being president of a club, and from that and other 
		  situations I have conflict resolution skills from interacting with a lot of people from different backgrounds who may not always see eye to eye on things and need 
		  to be approached the right way to get them to get along. I also have spent a great amount of time around my little sister who is still quite young and I've helped 
	  with taking care of her a lot and gotten experience dealing with kids from that, as well as babysitting some other kids on occasion. Being a teacher would also be ideal 
	  because it would mean that once I have kids I'd be able to be home most of the time when they're home since my work schedule would mostly line up with their school 
	  schedule so I'd get to spend more time with them that way and not have to put them in daycare constantly.</p>

			<p>I think this sounds like a great job for me because the work environment seems like it would be very lovely. I like the listed priorities which mention the 
			importance of a good learning environment and having teachers that are really enthusiastic about what they do and care a lot about children. I feel this place 
			has great values and would be satisfying to work at. I like that emphasis is placed on understanding the individual needs of the children in the school, because 
			that is something I find important as well.</p>

			<p>I really like the description of this job and the impression it instantly gives me. This seems like it would be a great environment to work in with a lot of 
			emphasis on fun and creativity. I think it sounds very sweet and I'm a fan of what it says about creating unique learning moments for kids because I think there 
			is a lot of value in that. I could really see myself enjoying a position like this and feeling welcomed by the friendly environment.</p>

			<p>I feel like this position is a bit more serious than the first two, but I think it's nice in its own way. The description is pretty thorough in listing what 
			will be expected, like fostering a calm and respectful atmosphere which I feel could be beneficial. I like how it lays everything out very clearly to give an 
			excellent idea of what work would be done each day. It seems like it would be a good working experience in a respectful environment.</p>
