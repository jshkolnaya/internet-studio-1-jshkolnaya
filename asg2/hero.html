    <h5>Publication History</h5>
      <p>Spider-Man 2099 was one of the many Marvel characters to be re-imagined for the Marvel 2099 comic book line that showed future versions of classic Marvel 
        characters living in the year 2099, approximately 107 years after the then-current Marvel Universe time period. Spider-Man 2099 was first featured in a 
        five-page sneak preview of the first issue of his then-upcoming series in the 30th-anniversary issue of The Amazing Spider-Man. The Spider-Man 2099 series' 
        first issue appeared shortly afterward. When originally published, the Marvel 2099 stories were meant to depict the official future of the Marvel Universe: 
        a dystopian America governed by corrupt megacorporations with a number of cyberpunk elements.</p>

      <p>The character was originally designed by artist Rick Leonardi, with Peter David brought onto the series as writer to flesh out the character's alter ego, 
            Miguel O'Hara, and supporting characters. Spider-Man 2099 #1 was written by Peter David, pencilled by Rick Leonardi, inked by Al Williamson, and lettered 
            by Rick Parker. David named the character after his friend, actor Miguel Ferrer. Spider-Man 2099 #1 is the highest-selling single issue of any comic 
            written by Peter David.</p>
