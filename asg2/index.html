    <h3>Pt 2 Questions</h3>
      <p><br>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?
        <br>Structured content basically means putting together content in such a way 
        that it can then be viewed using any interface and show up properly. 
        Semantic HTML on the other hand communicates how different elements within 
        html code relate to each other and explains the connections between them, 
        which is important for algorithms.
        
        <br><br>How do they work together? 
        <br>They make sure that both humans and algorithms can read whatever you've put in your 
        web page. The algorithms depend on the semantic HTML, and humans depend on structured 
        content to be able to view and comprehend your web page properly.
        
        <br><br>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?
        <br>It's important because then you can be sure that algorithms will be able to recommend your 
        web page among search results for someone seeking out something that they could find on 
        your page, and you can be sure that when that someone opens up your web page they'll be 
        able to read it in its proper format and won't feel lost or confused because everything is 
        all over the place or your links don't open on the device they're using or something like that.
