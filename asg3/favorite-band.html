	<h1>BTS</h1>
	<p>The K-Pop Group That Rocked the Music Industry</p>
	<p>BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; lit. Bulletproof Boy Scouts), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. 
		The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook, who co-write or co-produce much of their material. Originally a hip hop group, they 
		expanded their musical style to incorporate a wide range of genres, while their lyrics have focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age 
		youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, and the consequences of fame and recognition. Their discography and adjacent work has 
		also referenced literature, philosophy and psychology, and includes an alternate universe storyline.

	<br><p>BTS is my favorite band for several reasons, the biggest one being how much of an inspiration and comfort the seven of them serve to be for millions of their fans. They display genuine care for 
		their fans regularly and have done little things in the past like making hundreds of handmade gifts and cards to hand out to fans at an event. The way they establish a connection with their 
		fanbase in such ways leads to very dedicated fans and writing about important topics like mental health in their lyrics is often very meaningful to fans and can be comforting to them. I might not be a 
		very active fan at the moment but they're still my favorite band and I think it's great for artists to have a positive impact on their fanbase the way BTS does. Their fans also have created numerous projects 
		around the world in BTS's name to do things like plant more trees or donate to hospitals or great causes like that, due to how inspired they are by BTS and the positive messages they spread. Fans have even 
		managed to raise one million dollars within twenty four hours for a cause before. That's why I think the impact and influence the band has is super cool. I also think it's admirable how they started out with 
		a very poor company and had to all live in one cramped room and struggle to get their music out there, but through hard work and true passion they managed to gain more recognition and miraculously ended up 
		becoming one of the most popular groups in the world. And I like when a band also has a big part in writing much of their lyrics because it makes the music feel more real to me than when an artist exclusively 
		sings songs written for them by other people.
