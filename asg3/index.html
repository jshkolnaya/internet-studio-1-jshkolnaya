<h1>Reading Questions</h1>

<p>From the Do's and Don'ts of Web Design, provide a link to an example of a violation of number 6 (clickable elements are 
  not obvious).

<br><br>It was a bit difficult for me to really find a great example of this, but one that I feel has a slight issue with this 
  is <a href="https://mochipan.com/">Mochipan</a> because when you go to the site and scroll down to “shop by style” I feel 
  as if the images shown there don’t really jump out to me as looking like buttons despite them being intended to be buttons 
  and being clickable. When you move your cursor over them they become slightly larger in a way that makes it seem like you’re 
  meant to click on them so it’s not something that would cause most people confusion especially once they moved their 
  cursor around, but I do still think that they look much more like they’re simply example images of products than 
  clickable buttons and could be changed to look more clickable at first glance. 

<br><br>From the Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles: How can framing your project in a story format help you 
  refine your ideas? Write a paragraph explanation.

  <br><br>It really just makes it a lot easier to view what you're doing and what your plan is when you can better imagine 
  exactly what the purpose of what you're accomplishing is and how others will respond or interact with it, and it makes 
  sense that any project would end up turning out better if it's created with greater consideration of what people may be 
  thinking when they see and interact with different elements of it and experience what you've made.



<br><br>From Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography: What are different ways to establish hierarchy (or emphasis) 
  in typography design? Provide a link to a good example of hierarchy.

  <br><br>There are many ways to establish hierarchy through all the ways you can alter text, like by adjusting the size of it to 
  emphasize the first words you want someone to look at like titles or subheadings. The same effect can be achieved by changing the 
  color of text or italicizing it or making it bold, all of the above will draw attention especially when seen in contrast with simpler 
  more basic text. I think a good example of this being done is the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> website, where the name of the 
  site is bright orange and there are various headings for things that use different font sizes and have some in bold, as well as having 
  certain bits of text in gray so the black text they're next to will catch your attention first.

<h1>Creative Brief</h1>

  <br><br><p>The problem I’d like to address is that I don’t have a good way of recording what tea I drink, keeping track of how much I 
    drink, and easily categorizing what types I drink. I’ve been wanting to log the tea I drink for quite some time and do so in a way where 
    I can try to include information like caffeine content, the company the tea is from, exactly how much I had, what ingredients may be in it, 
    and more things like that. It would really help me keep track of what my caffeine intake looks like, what my favorite teas seem to be over 
    the course of weeks or months, and it would make it easier for me to recommend specific teas to friends by being able to show them more exact 
    details on the teas. My audience is really just myself and friends/family I’d say, because I’m the one who will be benefitting most from 
    keeping a clear record of the tea I drink but certain friends and family members can also benefit by being able to look at what I’ve recorded 
    and get recommendations for themselves from it. I suppose my competition would be other apps and sites that may have tea logging available, but 
    I wouldn’t consider them real competition for me specifically because I want to log more in depth info and specific things that these apps and 
    sites don’t seem to have as options. This is something I’ve wanted to do for a while, but it would’ve been less efficient doing it how I originally 
    might've ended up doing it which is by using a google doc, which would be much less pretty and organized looking than an actual website and wouldn't 
    allow me to add as many features. I'll consider this project a success if it ends up serving its purpose as it should and allows me to log tea how I 
    want while also being an easy website to navigate.
