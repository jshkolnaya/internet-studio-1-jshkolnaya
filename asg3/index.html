<p>From the Do's and Don'ts of Web Design, provide a link to an example of a violation of number 6 (clickable elements are 
  not obvious).

<br><br>It was a bit difficult for me to really find a great example of this, but one that I feel has a slight issue with this 
  is https://mochipan.com/ because when you go to the site and scroll down to “shop by style” I feel as if the images 
  shown there don’t really jump out to me as looking like buttons despite them being intended to be buttons and being 
  clickable. When you move your cursor over them they become slightly larger in a way that makes it seem like you’re 
  meant to click on them so it’s not something that would cause most people confusion especially once they moved their 
  cursor around, but I do still think that they look much more like they’re simply example images of products than 
  clickable buttons and could be changed to look more clickable at first glance. 

<br><br>From the Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles: How can framing your project in a story format help you 
  refine your ideas? Write a paragraph explanation.

  <br><br>It really just makes it a lot easier to view what you're doing and what your plan is when you can better imagine 
  exactly what the purpose of what you're accomplishing is and how others will respond or interact with it, and it makes 
  sense that any project would end up turning out better if it's created with greater consideration of what people may be 
  thinking when they see and interact with different elements of it and experience what you've made.
