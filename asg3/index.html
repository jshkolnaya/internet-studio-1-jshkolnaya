<p>From the Do's and Don'ts of Web Design, provide a link to an example of a violation of number 6 (clickable elements are 
  not obvious).

<br>It was a bit difficult for me to really find a great example of this, but one that I feel has a slight issue with this 
  is https://mochipan.com/ because when you go to the site and scroll down to “shop by style” I feel as if the images 
  shown there don’t really jump out to me as looking like buttons despite them being intended to be buttons and being 
  clickable. When you move your cursor over them they become slightly larger in a way that makes it seem like you’re 
  meant to click on them so it’s not something that would cause most people confusion especially once they moved their 
  cursor around, but I do still think that they look much more like they’re simply example images of products than 
  clickable buttons and could be changed to look more clickable at first glance.
