<h1>You're invited!</h1>

<h2>Miguel O'Hara</h2>
  <p>As one of my favorite fictional characters, Miguel would of course be deserving of a seat at my dinner table. I would specifically like to invite the 
  Across the Spider-Verse version of Miguel O'Hara and would have a lot of fun interacting with him despite how antagonistic he may be.</p>
  
<h2>Neil Postman</h2>
  <p>As the author of books such as 'Amusing Ourselves to Death' I would be most interested in having a dinner with Neil and having a thorough discussion 
  about the theories he wrote about. I'd love to hear his thoughts on the present situation of the world, and hear how he feels about the way his theories 
  relate to the world as it is right now.</p>
  
  <h2>Gandalf</h2>
    <p>As an incredible wizard from the world of Lord of the Rings, I think Gandalf is very deserving of a nice dinner and he would surely be happy to sit down 
    to enjoy a meal with me. I'd love to hear any wisdom he may have to offer me and feel that I would learn a lot from him even just through one conversation.</p>
