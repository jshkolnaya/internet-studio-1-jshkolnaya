  <h1>The Six Thinking Hats</h1>

    <h3><span style="color: white;">White</span> Hat</h3>
	  <p>We talked about how I already have the information of what sort of project I plan to create, a tea
logging site for myself with various details on all teas. Me and my partner did agree though that I
lacked information when it came to all the exact little details and things I want to include, so
that’s something that’ll need to be figured out before I start creating my site for sure. We also
agreed that revisiting my sitemap and making it more thorough would be a great idea as well so
I could form a clearer picture of how I want my site to look.</p>
	<h3><span style="color: red;">Red</span> Hat</h3>
	  <p>My partner thought that my idea was interesting and would be useful for me in my life, especially
my plan to include caffeine content in each entry logged because I’m meant to watch my
caffeine intake for a couple of health reasons. I’m feeling pretty enthusiastic about my project as
well, it may be a bit daunting considering it’s a “final project” which automatically makes me
more anxious about things, but I do think that this will be an enjoyable journey and great site for
me to use.
</p>
	<h3><span style="color: black;">Black</span> Hat</h3>
	  <p>There were a couple of potential problems that I discussed with my partner. The first was that
not all teas may necessarily have every bit of info I want to get from them, so we decided that it
would be fine to leave certain things blank for information I couldn’t find, and when it comes to
caffeine content it would be best to just google the average for the type of tea to input that in
entries where I maybe couldn’t discover the exact caffeine content from the tea’s packaging.
The other problem is that I’m not sure exactly how I’ll be logging everything, and how I should
set that up on my site, so that’s something I’ll need to think about more.
</p>
	<h3><span style="color: yellow;">Yellow</span> Hat</h3>
	  <p>We think my idea will work because it’s something I care about and am passionate about, so it’s
definitely something I want to see succeed. Most of the aspects to it are also simple enough that
I think it should be relatively easy to incorporate most of what I want to see on my site. My
partner also liked my idea of adding subsections to my site with lists of favorite teas and places
to buy tea for friends or family to potentially look at and get recommendations from.</p>
	<h3><span style="color: green;">Green</span> Hat</h3>
	  <p>My partner wasn’t really sure of what other good ways there may be to look at something like
this because it’s a project for a site that’s intended for me to use myself and have friends or
family potentially take a look at from time to time, but because it’s more for myself it’s a bit
difficult to consider it from other perspectives since I pretty much know what I want to do
already. My partner did say though that he thought it could be cool to incorporate more pictures
and instructions for others to look at that could be interesting, such as basic explanations of how
to brew tea in different ways and pictures to go along with everything. I think that would be pretty
cool as a way to spark more interest in anyone else viewing my site. There isn’t really a great
way to fix the black hat problems for now, aside from me just thinking more deeply about how to
handle them in a good way, but that’ll be easiest when I revisit my sitemap.
</p>
	<h3><span style="color: blue;">Blue</span> Hat</h3>
	  <p>My main goal with this project is just creating a detailed tea logging site to keep track of the tea I
drink, so I can note down all the different unique teas I try over time and also benefit from
tracking my caffeine consumption this way which will be beneficial for my health. We agreed that
I need to really make sure that my site will be readable and easy to navigate and not confusing
for anyone who may visit it. I’d like for it to look pretty and organized without having excessive
clutter or anything set up in a confusing way. Our conclusions from all the hats primarily just
indicate that I need to focus more on the details at this point, because I have a solid idea and
goals and am very much a blue hat sort of thinker I’d say, but I just really need to think a bit
more about which details I’m including and how I’m including them.</p>


  <h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>As I mentioned in my blue hat paragraph, the main thing I’ve taken away from my discussion
with my partner is that I should really focus more on what exact details I intend to incorporate in
my website for my project, so I can more quickly determine how to go about achieving my goals
and how to make everything work within my site. He also recommended that I try creating my
first entry for the tea logging in html before jumping right into creating my site, so I can get a
clearer idea of how I want it to be set up and can better understand how things should be
formatted. He said it would be good to make sure pretty early on that the css also looks good
and will style the page the way I want it to and won’t be getting messed up from entry to entry or
anything, so I won’t realize at the last minute that something is wrong and a bunch of things
need to be fixed. I think this was really good advice which I will definitely be taking, especially
considering my partner has far more programming/coding/scripting knowledge and experience
than I do and has learned over time that making sure things are looking correct from the start is
very important and makes projects go more smoothly.</p>
