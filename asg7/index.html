	<p>Percy Jackson is the perfect running mate. He has a strong moral compass and is most loyal and would do anything for those he cares about. He will provide all the 
     support that Annabeth needs to be the greatest president in history.</p>

	<h2>Who is she?</h2>
	<p>Annabeth Chase is a fictional character in Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus series. She is a demigod, half-mortal and half goddess. 
		Her father is the mortal Frederick Chase and her mother is Athena, the goddess of wisdom, crafts, arts, and battle strategy.</p>

	<h2>Why should she be president?</h2>
	<p>Annabeth Chase cares about knowledge more than most, seeing as her mother is the Greek goddess of wisdom. She spends lots of time reading and learning, and 
	truly has the brain for a leadership position. She performs well under pressure and has shown many times over that she can make critical decisions even when under 
	a lot of stress. She is also an incredible architect, even trusted by the gods of Olympus to redesign their palace. Having the trust of the major Greek gods has to 
	be one of the greatest recommendations you can get.</p>

	<h2>Top campaign platform</h2>
	<p>The United States of America has a critical problem, the architecture seen all around every state. It is becoming increasingly bland and boring, there isn't 
	enough affordable good quality housing for everyone, and public transportation is a mess. As an incredible architect endorsed by all the major Greek gods, 
	Annabeth would absolutely turn things around for the country and make sure that the architecture all around would undergo major improvements and be something 
	that every citizen would admire every day.</p>
