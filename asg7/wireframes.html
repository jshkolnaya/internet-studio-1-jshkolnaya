<h1>Reading and Wireframes</h1>

<h3>Questions</h3>
	<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of sketching wireframes over wireframe software?</p>
	<p>One of the advantages is that it can be really fast and efficient for anyone to start sketching out their ideas without being faced with numerous 
	options available digitally for formats and templates and such, which can take up more time and distract from ideas one may be actively having. It's 
	also great because it allows for ideas to be expressed at any level in any way without constraints that some software may have. Some disadvantages 
	however are that it is much more difficult to undo work in a sketch unless you're making very minor changes, and it's harder to collaborate on a sketch 
	physically with multiple people. It can also be difficult to have consistent sizing for elements, and some people may not be artistically inclined 
	enough to create a wireframe sketch that will be clearly legible or neat or pleasant looking. It also can't include the many fonts and styles for things 
	that can be found within software for wireframing.</p>
		
    <p>Write a paragraph on which type of wireframing style would work best with your project and why.</p>
	<p>I think some sort of wireframing software is the best choice for my project because although I could see myself enjoying making a sketch instead, 
	I know that I am an indecisive person who likes to change things frequently before settling on something, so physical wireframes wouldn't be the best 
	idea for me. Working digitally would give me the ability to test out different color schemes much more easily and all kinds of fonts or other ways of 
	formatting that I'd want to experiment with. I would be able to do all of that with a wireframing software of some kind, but if I were sketching I 
	would only be able to do some of these things and it would be far more time consuming. I would happily sketch if I were making a more simple wireframe 
	with just some basic ideas, but as I would like to include more details and test out certain formats and ideas more thoroughly, it makes the most sense 
	for me to use a software for this.</p>
