	<h1>Domain Names</h1>
	<h3>Partner Discussion</h3>
	<p>Three of the potential domain names I considered were steapingtea.com, loggingsteeping.com, and steepedleaves.com. My partner and I both agreed that steapingtea.com 
	did have the closest resemblance to my site name "sTEAped" which was a plus. The name loggingsteeping.com was also deemed fitting because I'd be logging the teas that I 
	steeped and drank. My partner's favorite was steepedleaves.com however, because it felt unique and more pleasant in a way than the other two names.</p>
	<h3>Decision</h3>
	<p>The name I think I'd like to go with is steepedleaves.com because I agree with what my partner said about it being a more unique name. I feel like it sounds pretty 
	cool and is a nice name for a site focused on tea.</p>
