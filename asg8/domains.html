	<h1>Domain Names</h1>
	<h3>Partner Discussion</h3>
	<p>Three of the potential domain names I considered were steapingtea.com, loggingsteeping.com, and steepedleaves.com. My partner and I both agreed that steapingtea.com 
	did have the closest resemblance to my site name "sTEAped" which was a plus. The name loggingsteeping.com was also deemed fitting because I'd be logging the teas that I 
	steeped and drank. My partner's favorite was steepedleaves.com however, because it felt unique and more pleasant in a way than the other two names, partly because of 
		the inclusion of the word "leaves" which may have an association with peacefulness for some people (at least it did for my partner).</p>
	<h3>Decision</h3>
	<p>The name I think I'd like to go with is steepedleaves.com because I agree with what my partner said about it being a more unique name. I feel like it sounds pretty 
	cool and is a nice name for a site focused on tea. It just makes sense and explains what my site is related to at first glance from the words "steeped leaves" because 
		all true teas are made from the leaves of the Camellia Sinensis plant. I do plan to include herbal teas in my site as well, but those aren't true teas and are 
	technically referred to as tisanes. So steepedleaves.com feels like a good fit for my site's domain name, seeing as my site's purpose is primarily from me to log the 
	teas (leaves) that I've steeped.</p>
