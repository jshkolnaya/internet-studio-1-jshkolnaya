	<h2>About me:</h2>
	<p>Some of my recent favorite hobbies have been yoga and cooking, which I hadn't done very much of prior to this year but seemed like good ways to improve 
	my life so I started getting into both this year and it's felt really nice. Another favorite hobby/interest of mine is brewing tea, and I've been doing that 
	for many years now. I'm also president of the UTeaD Tea and Coffee Club this year due to my interest in tea and enjoyment of the social atmosphere I experienced 
	last year when I first joined the club. If I had unlimited money one of my big goals in life would be to open a cafe, but since that's pretty hard to succeed 
	in doing I think my goal currently is to become an art teacher at an elementary school, and if I'm lucky maybe someday I'll get the opportunity to pursue my 
	cafe dream. </p>
