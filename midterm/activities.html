<h2>Fun things to do!</h2>
  <h3>Volcano sightseeing</h3>
<p>Many people have never even seen a volcano in their lives, much less an active one. In Iceland, you can walk right up to them and see real lava flowing! It's 
a unique and truly beautiful sight, certainly not the average activity.</p>
<h3>Bathing in a hot spring</h3>
  <p>There are many hot springs in Iceland that are warm and inviting all year long due to the geothermal activity keeping them pleasantly heated.</p>
  <h3>Seeing the northern lights</h3>
  <p>Witnessing the beauty of the aurora borealis is surely one of the greatest activities for someone visiting Iceland. The northern lights are mostly easily 
  viewed between the months of September and April, and Iceland is one of the most perfect places to visit to see them.</p>
