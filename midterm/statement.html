<h3>Design Statement</h3>
	<p>When I picked Iceland as my destination for this assignment, I pretty much instantly knew that whatever my animation was, it had to involve an image of the
	northern lights. I thought it would be really cool and fitting considering Iceland is known for being a great place to view the auroras, so that's why I thought it 
	would be fun to have an image of them sliding across the screen sorta in the background. All the colors I chose were shades of purple and green because those are 
	the main colors the auroras are seen in. And the html background color is meant to look like the night sky, so my animation with the northern lights image looks like 
	it really is in the sky.</p>
	<p>I chose sans serif fonts simply because I for some reason feel like Iceland gives off sans serif vibes and serif fonts wouldn't be as fitting for anything Iceland 
	related in my eyes haha.</p>
<h3>Citations</h3>
	<p>All paragraphs I typed myself without copying anything directly, but these are a few sites I got information from to include in my paragraphs:</p>
	<ul>
